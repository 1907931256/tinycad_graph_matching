libraries.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=3>The list in
the dialogue box is a list of libraries searched when the Get option
(in the Library menu) is used. You may add or remove these libraries
from this list using the buttons at the side of the list.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=3>The Add
button in the dialogue allows a library not currently being searched
to entered into the search list. When this option is selected a file
selection dialogue appears. Select the index file (those files with
.idx extensions), which belongs to the library you wish to use. The
library is then added to the list box.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=3>The Remove
button removes a library from the search list. It does not delete it!
Select the library you wish to remove by clicking on it in the list
box, then click on the remove button.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=3>The Edit
button allows you to:<BR>- View &amp; Print thumbnails of the
symbols<BR>- Add new symbols to this library<BR>- Edit existing
symbols in the library</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=3>The Tidy
button causes a library to be tidied up. Select a library to tidy by
clicking on it in the list, then click on the Tidy button. When the
library has been tidied a message box will appear informing you of
this.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Libraries
will need tidying after they have been extensively edited. Tidying
the library will make it smaller by removing the unwanted old (now
deleted) symbols in the library.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=3>Normally
symbols are saved with the design, so any changes to the libraries do
not effect your design straight away.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=3>This option
causes all the libraries currently in use to be re-read, and any
changes displayed in the current design. This only effects the design
in the current window.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4><B>Part in
Package</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=3>This option
can only be used when you are editing a library symbol.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=3>When a symbol
has more than one part per package, this option allows you to edit
each part individually.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=3>Each part in
the package must have the same symbol outline, but with different
pins. Therefore this option only effects the pins in the symbol.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">When
you select a new part per package, which has not yet been defined,
you will be given the option to copy over the pins in the current
part into the new part. Select Yes, if you wish to have the pins in
the same layout for each part in the package. This is highly
recommended. Once the pins have been copied, you can edit their pin
numbers using the Edit Item option in the Edit menu.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4><B>Add Pin</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=3>This option
can only be selected when you are editing a library symbol.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=3>Pins are used
to show where the connections to each symbol are.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=3>Pins of
various shapes are provided, however, these shapes are for cosmetic
purposes only. They do not effect how each pin is considered to be
connected.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=3>There are
various types of pin. These type govern how the electrical rules
checker operates. The electrical rules checker checks which pins of
what type are connected together and determines whether or not this
will produce a correct circuit.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=3>All pins must
have a pin number. If the device is not one that has pins numbers
(such a capacitor), then what the numbers are is arbitrary - but they
must all be different. Pin numbers can also include letters. This is
so the pins of a Pin Grid Array device can be correctly labeled.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=3>Pins can
optionally have a name. This is not necessary however.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=3>The pin
number and name can be shown or hidden. To hide the text click on the
check box next to the text in the dialogue box.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=3>Pins of type
power are special. Although they are shown when editing a symbol,
when the symbol is placed in a design these pins are hidden. Once the
symbol is placed in a design pins are automatically connected to the
power of the same value as their name. Therefore these pins must have
a name. This can be used in conjunction with the parts per package
option to allow the placing of, for example, logic gates, without
need to show the power connection explicitly. A power pin cannot be
connected to normally, all connections to this pin will be done
automatically.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=3>A pin of type
hidden will be shown when editing a symbol, as with power pins, and
hidden when the symbol is placed into a design. However, the normal
connections are expected to be made to this pin, even though it is
unseen. The symbol design must indicate where these pins are to allow
easy connection.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=3>Each pin is
associated with a part per package. A single symbol may have more
than one part per package. For example a 7400, consists of 4 NAND
gates. Each part has different pin numbers on each pin. To select
which part per package the pin you are placing belongs to use the
Part in Package option in the Library menu.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=3>To place a
pin click with the left hand mouse button in the design window. When
a pin has been placed, the pin number in the dialogue box will
automatically be advanced for you.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=3>Placing can
be canceled by clicking with the right hand mouse button.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=3>Once a pin is
placed the pin number is either incremented or decremented,
automatically for you. The Pin Increment/Pin Decrement options in the
repeat directions menu (in the Edit menu) select which way the pin
number is changed.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=3>Also if the
pin name has a number at then end of it then it too is also
incremented or decremented. The Name Increment/Name Decrement options
in the repeat directions menu (in the Edit menu) select which way the
pin name is changed.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=3>Pins can be
edited. To edit them select the Edit Item option in the Edit menu,
then click on the end of the pin (the same end as you placed, and
would connect a wire to).</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Pins
can also be moved or deleted.</FONT></P>
