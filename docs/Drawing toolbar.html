<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT SIZE=4><B>Delete Item</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=3>This option
allow you to delete objects in the design.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=3>To delete an
item first select the Edit Item tool. Select the item to delete by
clicking on it with the left hand mouse button. The object will turn
grey to indicate it has been selected. You may instead of selecting a
single item with the edit tool select a group of items. These too may
be deleted.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=3>Now select
this option on the toolbar menu to delete the item.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=3>You may undo
the deletion by using the undo option in the edit menu. </FONT></FONT>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT SIZE=4><B>Edit Item</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=3>This option
enables editing of objects already placed in the design. You may also
use this tool to move objects in your design and to delete objects in
your design.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=3>Once this
option has been selected then clicking with the left hand mouse
button on an object in the design will select that object. To show it
has been selected it will be shown in light grey.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=3>If there is
more than one editable object under the mouse pointer, then clicking
again with the left hand mouse button in the same place will cause a
different object to be selected. Keep clicking with the left hand
mouse button until the object you wish to edit is selected.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=3>If the object
is editable, then a dialogue box associated with the object will be
shown enabling you to change it. For example, if you click on a text
object then a dialogue box will appear with the text in it. You may
then change the text in the dialogue box.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=3>End editing
an object by clicking with the right hand mouse button in the design
window, or by selecting a new object to edit using the left hand
mouse button.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=3>You may also
move objects that are selected. To do this hold down the left hand
mouse button on a selected object. Now move the mouse, with the left
hand mouse button held down. The object will be moved with the mouse.
To finish release the left hand mouse button.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=3>You may
delete any selected object by using the delete item option on the
toolbar.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=3>You may copy
any selected object to the clipboard by selecting the Copy or Cut
options in the edit menu. Once a selection has been copied to the
clipboard it may be pasted into another application (such as
Microsoft Word), or pasted back into the design.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=3>To select
groups of objects you may drag a rectangle around the objects to be
selected. Any object within the rectangle will be selected. Once it
has been selected you may delete, move, copy or cut the object. To
drag the rectangle, place the pointer in an area of the design where
there is no object. Hold down the left hand mouse button and move the
mouse. The rectangle will be created. Release the left hand mouse
button to select the objects within the rectangle.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT SIZE=4><B>Junction</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=3>Junctions are
normally automatically placed for you.  You do not need to use this
tool.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=3>Junctions
indicate when two wires meet that they are electrically joined. This
information is used by the special tools to generate net lists and
check the electrical rules. When two wires meet or cross it is
assumed they are not joined unless a junction is placed at the
crossing point.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=3>To place a
junction select this option, then move the junction to the location
in the design where you wish to place it and then click with the left
hand mouse button. When you have finished placing, either select a
new tool or click with the right hand mouse button. This will select
the Edit Item in the Edit menu for you.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=3>Junctions
cannot be edited, but they can be moved or deleted.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT SIZE=4><B>Label</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=3>Labels
indicate a connection to the wire which runs beneath them. Any two
wires with the same label name above them are considered to be
connected.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=3>This can be
useful when two parts of a circuit need to be connected but are a
long way apart on the diagram, or one point needs to be connected to
a large number of others.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=3>It is often
required to have bars over the letters in the label. This can be done
by placing the ` character before each letter that needs a bar over
it. If a whole word needs to have a bar placed over it then each
letter in that word must have a ` before it.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=3>Type the text
you wish to add in the dialogue box. As you enter text a rectangle
will appear next to the mouse, indicating the size and position of
the text.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=3>Move this
rectangle with the mouse to where you wish to place it and click with
the left hand button.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=3>After placing
a label, if the text has a number on the end of it, it is
automatically incremented or decremented depending on the Name
Increment or Name Decrement option selected in the Repeat Directions
menu (in the Edit menu).</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=3>You can
cancel entering text by clicking with the right hand mouse button.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=3>Labels can be
edited once placed. To do so select Edit Item on the Toolbar. Then
click with the left hand mouse button on the text to be edited. A
window will appear with the original text in it. You can now alter it
as necessary. When finished either click with the left hand mouse
button on something else to edit, or click with the right hand mouse
button.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=3>Labels can be
re-sized once placed by using the handles displayed around the item
or by using the tool dialogue normally displayed in the top right
hand corner of the drawing.</FONT></FONT></P>

</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT SIZE=4><B>No Connect</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=3>No connects
indicate that the symbol, wire or power item is not connected to
anything else, and should not be connected to anything else. The
electrical rules checker will indicate an error if an input is
unconnected unless it has a no connect joined to it. Place no
connects on any unused input or output to avoid this error and
indicate that it is intentionally left unconnected.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=3>To place a no
connect select this option, then move the cross to the location in
the design you where wish to place it and then click with the left
hand mouse button. When you have finished placing, either select a
new tool or click with the right hand mouse button. This will select
the Edit Item in the Edit menu for you.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=3>No connects
cannot be edited, but they can be moved or deleted.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT SIZE=4><B>Power</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=3>Power objects
are use to show where power is connected to the design. All power
objects should have a value, which is the value of the power it
provides (such as 5V, GND, 0V etc.). All power objects with the same
value are considered connected to one another; even if they have
different shapes.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=3>You should
connect wires to the power items at the end of their pins, otherwise
they will not considered to be connected.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=3>Certain
symbols are automatically connected to power without the connection
being shown (for example the 7400, although no power pins are shown,
it is automatically connected to VCC and GND). When using these
symbols, you should make sure you use the same power supply names as
the symbols otherwise the symbol will not be correctly connected to
the power supply.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=3>To place
power items in to your designs select power from the Toolbar. Then in
the dialogue box select the orientation of the power item, it's shape
and it's name. Place the power item by clicking with the left hand
mouse button.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=3>A range of
shapes is provided, and you may use any name. Bars may be added over
letters in names in the same manner bars can be added to text and
labels, that is by placing ` before each letter which requires a bar
over it.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=3>Once you have
finished placing power items click with the right hand mouse button
or select a new tool.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=3>Power items
can be edited. To do so select Edit Item in the Edit menu. Click with
the left hand mouse button on the end of the power item's pin. You
can now change it's name, orientation and shape. When finished either
click with the left hand mouse button on something else to edit, or
click with the right hand mouse button.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=3>Power items
can also be move and deleted.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT SIZE=4><B>Wire</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=3>Wires are
used to indicated connections on the circuit diagram. If you wish to
use features such as the electrical rules checker or net list
generation then you must use wires for this purpose. If you use lines
instead of wires to join up points on a diagram then these tools will
not work!</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=3>Click with
the left hand mouse button in the place you wish to start the wire.
Move to where you wish the wire to end and click with the left hand
button again. A wire segment will be placed and a new wire segment is
now started from this point.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=3>If you prefer
you can drag wires instead of using the clicking and then moving. 
Simply drag with the left hand mouse button from the starting point
to the ending point.  If the ending point is a symbol, another wire
or a power item then the wire will automatically snap to it and
terminate at that point.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=3>A wire will
automatically snap to a placed symbol or another wire when moved
close to it.  If you click with the left hand mouse button now, the
wire will end at the snapped point.  You can turn this off by using
the settings dialogue in the Options menu.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=3>When placing
wires junctions will automatically be added when required.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=3>To stop
drawing click with the right hand mouse button, and you may start a
new wire from a different point. Clicking with the right hand mouse
button again will select the Edit Item option in the edit menu.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=3>Normally the
wire is locked to 90 degree positions. In this mode two line segments
are displayed at once. However, only one segment is placed at a time
when you click with the left hand mouse button. You must click once
more to place both the bus segments.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=3>You may also
lock to 45 degree angles only, or have no locking at all. This can be
selected from the edit window. When these options are used, only one
wire segment at a time is displayed.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=3>If you find
when you try and place two wire segments in rapid succession and find
that only one is placed, then the cause is properly due to the double
click speed of the mouse being setup so that it is too slow. Go to
the Control Panel and alter the double click speed faster. (See the
Window's Manuals for more details).</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=3>Wires cannot
be edited, but they can be moved, dragged or deleted.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=3>Wires can be
repeated.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT SIZE=4><B>Zoom</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=3>The zoom tool
enables you to easily enlarge the view of the design. Once selected
you may enlarge the view by clicking with the left hand mouse button,
and reduce the view by clicking with the right hand mouse button.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=3>The position
of the mouse pointer, when you zoom in, is moved to the centre of the
window.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=3>You may also
use the scrollwheel to zoom.</FONT></FONT></P>
